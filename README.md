# ProductTracer

ProductTracer is a project that started with the intention of creating a login page using .NET Core Web Api for the backend and Flutter for the mobile part. However, during development, the decision was made to add product service functionalities as well. Due to this reason, the API project is named "login," but it also contains product operations.

## Tech Stack
- .Net Core Web Api 3.1
- Flutter 3.10.6
- JWT Bearer
